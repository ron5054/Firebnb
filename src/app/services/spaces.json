We could have breakfast at her place which was perfect because she has a little sweet balcony! \r\nLocation: calmly situated in a side street, very near to the Placa Catalunya, the Rambla and the gothic area of Barcelona (very beautiful:)) so you have the old cultural center as well as all the restaurants and bars just nearby.\r\nHouse/Room: the appartment is not a huge, but I think you have everything you need (beautiful sitting room, balcony, kitchen) in it. You have to share the appartment with Marian so pay attention and don't be too loud in the evening!!\r\ndisadvantage: the heat is terrible in summer and there is no air-condition..\r\n\r\nI would overall recommend it to everybody!! But if you want to party and stay up late, take a hostel or another appartment.",

From the moment we booked Cynthia could not have been more helpful with everything and was always ready and willing to answer all of our queries. Cynthia provided us with an extensive list of recommendations for our stay on Maui and we were not disappointed. The condo is located in a quiet but convenient neighbourhood and close to many amenities. We found the condo extremely spacious and it accommodated our party of 3 adults and two teenaged children with no problem at all. Cynthia's condo is the penthouse and is set right on the beach so we were treated to gorgeous Hawaiian sunsets every night, as well as being able to see turtles and whales from our balcony. The condo is beautifully presented and very well equipped - we could not have asked for anything more for our nine day stay. \r\nMahalo Cynthia ",

It was a very cozy place to come back to after long days out exploring New York. The subways are very close. We preferred heading up to broadway to catch our trains (Depending where we were going) only because it was much more pleasant on sunny days to be above grounds if we could. It was great to have all amenities available, and at such a reasonable price.The only thing I will mention is that if you do plan on sleeping in- it might not happen as they do have a newborn who you can sometimes hear in the morning if you are a light sleeper.\r\nOverall,  I would recommend you stay at Alex & Shailas airbnb!

Thank you Nihat. \nRegarding the apartment, it is exactly as described. The room is nice and bed is comfortable. It was clean and well prepared for us. \nRegarding the neighborhood, it is very close to Taksim square and Istiklal Street with few minutes walk. As normal as it is in Istanbul, there is a short hill you need to walk to get to the square, which was totally fine with us. \n\nIn general, next time I visit Istanbul I would first check the availability with Nihat before searching others.",

Be it in spoken or written form I always got my answers from her within no times. She also proofed to be very flexible in terms of arrival and departure times which I appreciated a great deal. If you are a fan of jazz music (like I am), make sure to double check ahead of time about her current concert dates so as not to miss your hostess on stage like I did (grumble ;-)).\n\nThe room I occupied was the smaller one of two that Isabel rents out. So if her flat is fully rented out there can be a maximum of 4 guests plus your hostess in the flat, which can cause some bathroom jam, especially during the hot and humid summer times, when the need for a cool shower is inherent to everyone's desire. \nMy room was as depicted. If you plan on using it for double occupancy, I recommend taking Isa's larger room (unless the two of you are very much in love and want to cuddle up close ;-)). Also, if you need a table for writing, ask for the larger room as well, which comes along with one.\nThe flat itself is absolutely enchanting and furnished with love and an artistic eye to details. It's location is a dream for touristic explorations with anything within walking distance. \nTherefore, I can easily recommend both Isabel and her flat to anyone wishing to immerge himself into the local customs and get a good doze of what it is like \"to live like a true Barcelonian\".  \n\nQuerida Isa, muchas gracias por tu hospedalid génial! Volveré a ciencia cierta!\nSaludos y besos\nLiliana",

                "txt": "The apartment is very centrally located, in the heart of the gothic part of the city and a couple of blocks from the Placa de Catalunya which makes transportation and sightseeing very easy. It's a 20 minute walk from the beach which is a plus. It's located in a very old building on the top floor, so it is rather stuffy and warm in the apartment. The room overlooks a very narrow street/alley so it's rather dark and it's easy to hear the noise coming from the street and the neighboring apartments. There are a few other rooms in the house that are being rented out, so other people will be staying in the house which makes it a necessity to lock the room when you leave the apartment. \n\nIt's important to note that this place has a very strict check out time. On our last day, we had an evening flight but had to check out in the morning. When we asked if we could check out late, Isa told us to take our stuff to the train station and use the lockers there, but the train station does not have lockers. We ended up renting a locker  at a place called \"Barcelona lockers\". That, I would say changed all the plans for the last day. \n\n",

Isabel is a creative, sensitive and respectful person, with an open mind- yet she has the necessary boundaries that are required to organize an environment where so many different people are going to stay and hopefully enjoy. \nThe street itself is very lively, but the noises didn't bother me at all as i could easily block them out with earplugs. The location could not have been more sentral, still it's on \"the right side\" of the Rambla, where you can find more independent shops, restaurants, cafes and bars compared to the same leveled streets towards Raval. It is an old and very charming building, so if you want an minimalistic experience with cold, stainless steel and elevators this is not the place for you! And perhaps you are not the right person for this place either ;) I had to leave earlier due to illness, and was so sorry i couldn't stay throughout the whole month as planned. Hope to be seeing Isabel and her welcoming surroundings again one day ",

Nos proveyó de un matress de aire para nuestra amiga que vino de M.A. y se quedó una noche con nosotros. El barrio nos pareció bien, no tuvimos ningún incidente. Muchos puertoriqueños y Dominicanos, así que nos sentimos como en casa. Todo fue muy cómodo y limpio. Los vecinos hicieron mucho ruido en las noches, pero no fue problema para nosotros.

The only downside was that there was no AC. Given, it was my fault for not checking the listing, and although I thought we wouldn't survive a night there, you felt a nice cool breeze when you opened both front and back doors so the AC wasn't needed after all.  (One of the neighbors came to yell at me because one of the babies was crying so I had to keep the door shut) The location was perfect! It was walking distance to the very popular breakfast spot \"The Gazebo\" and to the Napili Bay that is very beautiful and you can see turtles.

Despite there are a lot of people in this Condo Complex (Napili Ridge), we didn't feel the place to be crowdy (as well as elsewhere in Hawaii). While the most interesting activities (IMHO) are in Lahaina, there is just 12-15 min drive. You can drive elsewhere on Maui within 3.5-4 hours (one way).\n____________________________________________________________________\nFacilities/Equipment:\nIt really looks recently renovated, all facilities and equipment are good. There is a fridge, microwave and regular oven, plates and silverware. We enjoyed having breakfast on Patio with a nice garden view. Parking lots are not the issue - you just need to fill the form and submit it to management office.\n____________________________________________________________________\nCleanliness:\nThe place was clean as expected. Host provided to us beach and bathroom towels which was greatly appreciated\n____________________________________________________________________\nOverall\nGreat value-for-money deal for Hawaii travelers who don't want to spend tons of money for vacation. Note that rental car is required in most cases when travelling to Maui.",

We're here in Winter so it's quiet.\nWe did think when we booked that it was the full house in the photo, but it's actually split (a duplex) and you share a wall. We were lucky enough not to have anyone next door. It's about 18 minutes from any freeway and 55 minutes to the gorgeous beaches of Aiya Napa, but we couldn't change places while hearing the sound of the sea all day with that view. It was our favorite. We purchased a stainless steel pan, since I'm wary of scratched Teflon. The resident walk path is on the right side, but we were never woken up with noise and the planes landing in Larnaca were totally manageable. I imagine it's really lively in the Summer, but January in a pandemic is was perfect and quiet for us.\nThe staff is amazing. One woman gave me her own Tylenol after I had an accident. They were so professional and accommodating as we kept extending our stay. It's been almost 21 days here and we didn't find anything else on Airbnb where you were this close to the water and a little beach. We listen to the waves each might and it's pretty magic.",

You need a car to stay here - though you could taxi in and out to the local supermarket (about 10 miles away from memory).\nThe little snack shop/cafe by the pool does reasonable/affordable pool food, which one could live off entirely for a few days if needed.\nWe are fussy and would stay here again. It is a little pricier than alternatives but that reflects the higher end location (and the fact that these villas retail at over EUR1 million)",

A guard lady opened the gate for us and handed over the keys. Everything was very straightforward.\nThe next morning I had to briefly leave the passport details in the reception.\nThe system makes a very new and technically high-quality impression. There is WiFi everywhere.\nThe apartments facing the sea are facing east. The master bedroom on the 2nd floor has 100% sunrise from the front... great!\nThe 3 bedrooms are spacious, and so are most bathrooms. The bathroom at the master bedroom is a bit small, here you could add storage spaces for utensils.\nWith the air conditioning in all rooms, everything was quickly heated up in December/January as well. From the garden you can go directly to the sea.\nThe hosts are very straightforward and friendly. If something doesn't work (1x WiFi, 1x water with friends in another apartment), it will be fixed immediately.\nIt's very private. Upon check out I reported 2 broken glasses. No charge was made. We also didn't need to make a deposit. Great complex, great also for the children who can run around freely here (for children who cannot swim only with parents, as the main pool and garden pools are freely accessible.\nA great place to stay with great service. 10 out of 10!\nThanks and happy to come back again and again!",

Made me feel right at home immediately, shared stories, some wine, helped me translate some things;), always helped with directions, they just made their home feel like my home:)  So laid back, so genuinely nice.  It was a total pleasure staying there, I'd suggest them to Anyone!",

I met nice people who gave me good advices to get around Sydney. David, the host, is very responsible and responded on the post to my emails while I was there. Being large, the house is very quiet and no one really bother anyone else. A cleaner shows up everyday, they were two ladies when I was there. They do an amazing job keeping the place spotless, and they are also very sweet. Now, Coggee is an amazing place. The house is up the street from the beach- there is also a large green park next to the beach. It's really nice. I went swimming at the ladies bath (sometype of sea water swimming pool on the beach) the first morning despite being Winter: amazing! I find that the picture showing Coggee beach do not make justice. It is so much more beautiful. I can't wait to go back there.

From the spacious living areas to the modern decor, Leila's condo is located in a prime spot with spectacular views of the Pacific Ccean. After staying at her place, I wanted to highlight 4 great things about our experience: \n\n1) Resort amenities- there is a complimentary shuttle that can take you between the Ritz Carlton and Montage resorts from your villa, along with other places in the Kapalua resort. This is great, especially for trying the top rated restaurants at the resorts without having to pay for parking...plus you can have a glass (or bottle) of wine and let someone else worry about the driving :) Or you can walk!\n\n2) Accessibility- Whether you are looking to take in a nice stroll along the beach or play a round of golf, her villa is nestled right in the heart of the Kapalua Resort. Even in the rain, you can enjoy the nice pool with a covered eating area! And I need to mention that the views from her condo are breath-taking, so if you fancy a night in, hers is the place to do it!\n\n3) Her Condo- I've stayed at hotels and resorts before, but I have to say that her villa exceeds anything you can find at a high end resorts. The wi-fi was strong and fast - able to be used among multiple devices. And the entire space was so clean! We had the security of knowing that the crew didn't just do a once over and be done, but actually took the time to make sure that it was ready and prepped for us, as if no one had stayed there before us. I'm a stickler for very nice bedrooms and beds, and hers was not only comfortable, but also offered me a great night's rest after a day of beach, beach and more beach :)\n\n4) Leila & Dan - They have been a gracious host, allowing us to stay at their condo. They were quick to respond, always providing us with best in class service, and were able to provide some great recommendations on activities and events to do on the island. \n\nI want to thank you for taking the time to read my review. Our experience staying at Leila and Dan's condo was great, and we truly enjoyed the time we spent on Maui. I cannot thank them enjoy for allowing us this great and special opportunity, and for giving us a chance to experience this beautiful island in a way that like no other. For this we are very grateful! \n\nWe wish you all the best in booking your stays through AirBnb and hope you have the opportunity to stay at Leila and Dan's condo... we hope to as well very soon! \n\nMahalo!",

The house is walking distance from a small beach, and is a quick drive to the Honolua General Store which has coffee, pastries, sandwiches and hot food, toiletries, towels, sunblock... pretty much everything. \n\nThe house comes equipped with travel size shampoo, body wash, hair conditioner, and bar soap. It also has a small hair dryer.\n\nThere are beach umbrellas and chairs in the backyard ready to be taken to the beach.\n\nThe wind gusts can get a little loud at times, I think because of how the house is situated on the hill. The bed was a little bit lumpy, but mostly soft and comfortable. The house renovations are gorgeous and look brand new, and there's a huge second bathroom with a great bathtub not pictured in the photos! Very clean, bright, and lovely. As other reviewers said, the photos do *not* do this house justice.\n\nOverall, it was a wonderful place to stay. Thank you!",

When we where entering to the place from Elise the Puamana Ocean Breeze Bungalow we felt like at home. The place is even better as shown on the picture. It is very clean and tastefully furnished. The kitchen has everything you need to cook. And all the bedrooms are very nice. You got even surfboards or bikes to use. We had every morning our breakfast on the porch which was always a very nice start into the day. From the house you will get in approx. 30“ to the ocean where you can enjoy every day the moast romantic sunsets. Its just fantastic. Puamana Ocean Breeze Bungalow is located close to Lahaina where you also find a lot of nice restaurants and grocery stores. And from Puamana you also can do realy nice daytrips like going snorkeling or do the road to Hana, to Wailea Makena or you go to Haleakala where you have a nice few on 10000 Feet over Maui (if the weather is nice) And if you just feel like relaxing than the ocean pool from Puamana is the perfect place just to calm down an enjoy the beauty of the pacific. Right in front of the club house are two surf spots where my son and daughter went surfing every morning. We just can highly recomand this beautiful place and we are still overwhelmed. Thank you so much Elise for having us. You have been always so nice and flexible and did respond very quick to our e-mails and answers. We had a realy great time and we will miss this quiet and romatic place. We just love Maui and all the other Hawaiian Islands. \nMahalo for everything. \n\nLajos and Family",

Do not miss the ocean front pool - it's spectacular.\nDon't hesitate to book here - it's a great value and you'll love every minute of your stay!",

Loud music from neighbors late at night and the busy street wasn't all that fun for an early sleeper like myself dealing with jet lag but it's out of Gwen's control so I just put my earplugs in and hoped for the best.

There aren't many things to do in the area, but with the subway so close, it didn't really matter to us.\n\nAt first glance, the neighborhood appeared a little sketchy and run-down, but we never had an issue.

And you could even find a copy of Animal Farm on the shelf, LOL. This really is what airbnb should offer in the first place, not some small and smelly hostel rooms without a window.\n\nThe host: quick response, easy communication, friendly permanent roommate. \n\nTo summarize: awesome place, would definitely come back and also recommend to friends.\n\n\n\n在香港住过不下十家的Airbnb平价旅店里,Felipe是我目前的最佳选择｡地点便利,步行五至十分钟可达坚尼地城地铁站｡楼下就有7/11便利店(有免费wifi),数家粉面店､茶餐厅(120闷二人晚餐好超值),Watson､百佳､惠康超市｡Felipe的房间安静､干净,空调无味｡起居室有沙发很舒适,附带厨房､洗衣机､冰箱｡书架上还有动物农场和其他一些书,不知可不可以拿来看｡｡｡与房主沟通很好,回复很快｡永久室友(真*房东)也很友善｡总之,远远好过无窗劏房小旅馆｡强烈推荐｡",

Which got hot in the room but it was humid when we stayed at.\nThere was no sideway outside the resort which was not safe to walk outside.\nThere were some bikers staying there as well which was loud sometime because of the bike. \n\nIf you to want walk around in Kihei then I would recommend another place near the kamaole beach 1-3.\n\nOverall, it was a ok stay for us but my kids loved the place because they had the upstairs to themselves.

The place had a lovely vibe and even the bed and the pillows were comfy – and we have a Tempur at home so I’m very picky with beds!  Oh and the artwork is awesome!\r\n\r\nThe garden is lovely too and it’s a short walk to the end of the street to the beach and the national park. The beach is GORGEOUS!! Crystal clear, calm water and pretty seashells. Its also nice and protected so you don’t get blown away or sandblasted which happens on some other beaches.  Just past the beach is a path to the national park, which is so pretty. There were lots of birds and trees and beautiful giant rocks and some Aboriginal carvings. \r\n\r\nIt bucketed rain most of the weekend we were there but we still had a lovely weekend. We’ve already booked our return visit for next month. :-) Thanks Belinda! \r\n",

L'appartamento era pulitissimo e dotato di tutti i comfort, in più Joao ci ha fatto trovare già molto cibo all'interno dell'appartamento e ci ha descritto tutti i posti da visitare migliori spiegandoci anche tutti i mezzi di trasporto da utilizzare.\r\nL'appartamento è a dir poco spettacolare con una bellissima vista sull'oceano.\r\nDalla posizione di Joao possiamo raggiungere in 20 minuti il centro di porto in bus ed in più subito sotto casa sua c'è un ristorante sushi che è buonissimo e di ottima qualità più moltissimi altri ottimi ristoranti e bar dove fare un buon aperitivo.\r\nJoao è una persona disponibile e ad ogni evenienza ti risponde subito dandoti una mano.\r\nPer finire in bellezza, l'ultimo giorno ci ha anche offerto il taxi per andare all'aereoporto.\r\nLa sua ospitalità ha superato in ogni modo le nostre aspettative. \r\nEsperienza assolutamente consigliata e da ripetere!\r\nUn saluto e un grazie a Joao dall'Italia.",

We felt we were treated royally. \nThe apartment is well equipped for self catering and a well stocked larder.  Joao made some very good local restaurant (many in close proximity ) recommendations too. Major Supermarket other end of beach so handy to have bikes as transport. \nEverything made available from washing machine to bedding. Massive walk in wardrobe. Hot water reliable. \nHis knowledge of Porto and provision of maps and information including travel cards was very helpful. There is a bus stop very close which takes you into the city in about 40 minutes for only €1.85. Matosinhos is a 20 minute walk away where you can pick up Metro, visit a market or eat at the many fish restaurants (fresh from fish market adjacent).\nWe made good use of the bikes and this saved us time and expense also.\nWe took the brilliant cycle way (no hills!) along the coast for about 20 km (Vila do Conde and beyond). Beaches and cafes all the way so a great escape for the day.\nUnfortunate the lift not always working but we survived and our fitness improved. \nProbably true of all apartments of any height, you do get some road noise and barking/ howling from local dogs.\nHappy to return to what became home away from home for nearly 2 weeks.\nThankyou Joao for making it possible. \n",

It is right on the ocean overlooking a wonderful beach with good waves for surfing. \n\nI am really happy I stayed here. The pollution from the cars in downtown Porto is intense. João's place has clean air. \n\nThere is a nice bike path that goes to the downtown and João has two bikes for guest use. \n\nThere is a large fish market a few blocks away that also has vegi's. There is a wonderful sushi bar downstairs from the apartment. \n\nJoão's place is well situated, with easy access without traffic. This is a huge plus! The downtown can get gridlock. \n\nJoão is a friendly, helpful host. \n\nI hope you enjoy your stay. \n\nBrad",

There's a tennis club next door so if you enjoy tennis, this is an ideal place. Two pools very close to the condo with BBQ grills for use as well.

We were able to make the most of the beautiful beach in Wailea. We were able to park both of our hire cars right at the front door of the condo, which made getting around Maui so much easier. The condo is in a great location, only a 3 minute drive to the beach and a stroll to some great restaurants and shops. There is a supermarket 10 minutes up the road which was good to be able to make use of the fully equipped kitchen. The washing machine and dryer were a bonus. Jim was extremely efficient with all communications prior to and during our stay and made the entire trip a breeze. I would recommend this place for families wanting a relaxing holiday. ",

Sie hat uns immer auf den neusten Stand gebracht was kulturelle Aktivitäten in Porto angeht, hatte gute Tipps für Ausflüge oder Restaurants und war schnell zur Stelle wenn wir Hilfe brauchten (z.B. bei Wegbeschreibungen). \r\nDas Appartment entspricht genau dem was auf den Bildern zu sehen ist sowie einer perfekt ausgestatteten Küche, also eine nette, kleine, sehr saubere Wohnung mit Stil und ausreichend Platz für 2. Es liegt ziemlich genau zwischen Altstadt und Strand und beides ist gut mit dem Bus (ca. 10 Minuten) oder einem längeren Spaziergang zu erreichen. Die Umgebung ist ein eher ruhiges Geschäftsviertel mit guten Einkaufsmöglichkeiten für den alltäglichen Bedarf. Ein tolles, nettes, portugiesisches Restaurant/Imbiss ist direkt um die Ecke. Wir hatten einen tollen Urlaub! Der natürlich zu kurz war.",

Des boutiques vintage ou design, sont à côté d’autres endroits qui vendent des produits électriques pour artisans comme nous n’en voyons plus à Paris. Nous avons été si bien accueillis par Alexandra qui s’occupe de la maison. Elle parle un français parfait et l’anglais aussi. Elle nous a donné plein de bonnes informations pour profiter de Porto. La maison, elle-même est magnifique. Elle vient juste d’être rénovée. Nous avons adoré la pierre que la propriétaire a sauvegardée sous les fenêtres et autour des portes et les volets typiques à l’intérieur. La décoration est très soignée. Là aussi, un mix d’objets très design, comme la superbe lampe dans la cuisine ou dans le salon et des petits meubles vintage un peu partout, très beaux. La cuisine est un bonheur. On pouvait prendre notre petit déjeuner sur la terrasse qui donne sur un petit jardin adorable où l’on peut descendre par un large escalier. Nous avions un grand choix de vaisselle magnifique. Les chambres sont aussi très confortables. Chacune avait sa salle de bains. Mais le must, c’est les draps. Nous avons eu l’impression de dormir dans un hôtel 5 étoiles. Douillets et soyeux à souhait. J’aimerais avoir les mêmes chez moi ! La bibliothèque du salon contient plein de livres intéressants et une bonne collection de dvd. On s’est senti chez nous, avec un certain luxe en plus !

Also very much enjoyed meeting some of your lovely friends in the neighbourhood at Mondo Deli. \n\nA word of warning though when staying at Zahia's home, her beds are so comfortable, they will wrap their silky sheets around you and not want to let you go  : ) zzzz\n\nCould not recommend more highly to visit Porto and Zahia's home.\n\nObrigado\n\n: ) errol \n\n\n",

I walked to Mrs McQuarries point one day and it took just over an hour to do so, buses take 10-15 minutes to central. Paddington itself is a cute neighbourhood with some nice places to eat/drink/shop nearby. Quite a few steps to take up to the flat just for anyone who might have issues with that, I didn't.

The apartment is not really optimal for small children, because of the rickety staircase. But we made due with the sleeping arrangements on the first floor and had a great time.\r\n\r\nThe apartment is small but very nicely decorated and was exactly as described. The location is great. Just next to the Ponte Luís I bridge and the riverside restaurants. The apartment faces away from the water but this allows for a small terrace facing toward the cliff side, which was very nice for a spot of air. \r\n\r\nHugo also has a deal with a breakfast delivery service, whom left a beautiful basket outside our door. The service also catered to Hugos high service standard and replaced the coffee in our basket with chocolate milk, which was immensely more popular with our children.\r\n\r\nI can only give my best recommendation to both Hugo and the apartment. It is a beautiful space in a prime location at a semi affordable rate. We only gave slightly more than we would have paid for a cheap hotel and half of what we would have paid at a nice one.",

We were not told that the code to get into the front door and to our apartment would be voided exactly at noon.  We had to make a quick run to a shop just next door and got back to the apartment and could not get in.  We were 5 minutes late.   We finally got in and the cleaning crew was waiting for us with some very impatient faces.  We were all packed, we just had to toss a couple of things in a bag and leave.  We always tip cleaning crews, and this time we were able to hand the tip to them in person, which seemed to ameliorate the situation.  Otherwise, all went smoothly.

Judy was very nice and welcoming, providing a supply of breakfast staples as well as great hints about neighborhood cafes and restaurants.  My mother - always apprehensive about parking - was especially pleased that there is lots of free on-street parking available in the surrounding neighborhood.  Judy was easy to correspond with in advance and to connect with the day they arrived - she's very responsive, and even let me preview the space to ensure it would be accessible for my older parents. I hope the apartment is available the next time they visit Brooklyn - which they are excited to do as a result of a very restful, comfortable weekend.",

You can walk down Atlantic Avenue or State to get to Brooklyn Bridge Park (which is quite lovely!).  It's about a 10 minute walk.

Within walking distance is the buzzing Fulton Mall, and the more elegant Smith St. and Court St. Plenty of restaurants, bars, bakeries and cafés. Judy and Sasha provided us with a list of their favorite places - Don't miss Van Leeuwen's unforgettable organic Ginger Ice Cream ! Catch the A and C lines at the Hoyt-Schermerhorn station, one block away, and ride to downtown Manhattan in ten minutes... \r\n\r\nJudy and Sasha are discreet hosts, yet very caring.

Le quartier regorge de restos, cafés, bars et boulangeries. Sasha et Judy fournissent une liste de leurs endroits préférés. A un pâté de maison, vous trouverez les lignes A et C à la station Hoyt Schermerhorn, qui vous emmène dans le Sud de Manhattan en dix minutes...\r\nJudy et Sasha sont des hôtes discrets et prévenants.

The neighborhood is truly in the fashion of a Bohemian San Francisco with steep winding streets and many excellent restaurants, flea markets,and designer shops all near by.\r\nThe best surprise of all was the the fantastic roof patio where one can sit and see the beautiful views of the Golden Horn and the Blue Mosque in the distance.\r\nThe rooms are airy and light with tall ceilings, and her personally designed cabinets and interior ,had such a simple elegant feel.\r\nThe separate bedroom is extremely cool in the summer and relaxing ,which has a view to the back over a tree covered 400 year old Hamam .The combined call to prayer and  the sound of many birds is positively magic. \r\nI highly recommend this Flat\r\nMichael Schmitt \r\nSanta Barbara California ",

The wifi is fast and reliable. The only downside is the distance from the city center. However, the bus stop is basically around the corner, with frequent busses running from early in the morning until late in the evening.\n\nThank you Ivo for everything, I hope to see you again this summer ;)",

También a unos cuantos metros puedes coger el metro que te deja en la parte alta del centro de Oporto pero es bastante ruidoso.\r\nEl piso está muy bien para los que quieren combinar playa con ambiente de la ciudad de Oporto.\r\nNosotros íbamos en familia con niños (12-14) y nos encajó bien. Pasamos un par de días en Oporto (pateada, paseo en barco, funicular, telesférico, tranvía...) y otros dos en Matoshinos y en Leca da Palmeira (surf, piscinas de mar, baños...). El agua del mar fría, conviene neopreno.\r\nBueno, que hemos pasado unos días estupendos y entretenidos.\r\nFelicidades a los portugueses por hablar inglés y más o menos español y hacerse entender.

As únicas questões a apontar são o facto da casa de banho ter estado com alguns problemas aquando da nossa chegada e só fomos alertados então. Gostaríamos de ter sido alertados antes de ter lá chegado. No entanto foi tudo resolvido e ficamos contentes por isso. Obrigada e até à próxima.",

The water was hot, the wi-fi worked perfectly. The only negative that I had about the room was the noise. \r\n\r\nThe unit is situated on the 2nd floor of the building right outside a busy street. Every night around midnight, two bars would open up across the and start blaring music. The music would not stop until 8am the next morning. I ended up having to buy a white noise machine just to last through the night.\r\n\r\nThe only other feedback I had was around Fabio, the host. All of the reviews mentioned how responsive and helpful he was. However that was not the case for me. The day I booked, I couldn't get him to respond to the booking. I even had to have AirBnB call him. And then I asked him about touring the city. Instead of offering, he pointed me to a few self serve options. When I asked again, he said he would plan a trip then never responded. When I responded to him, he said he was too busy and my trip was over. \r\n\r\nFabio being my tour guide is not a huge requirement, but I had thought he would be more willing (or suggest someone), given the feedback people had for him o this site.\r\n\r\nAll in all, great place if you don't mind the noise and don't need a helpful host.

(4) Initially no curtain on downstairs outside door so morning sun came in. Solved by rigging up a sheet to cover window in door. (5) Lack of aircon downstairs. Fan only. Downstairs bedroom would be too hot in summer.",

He was very responsive to any questions our group had; including being extremely accommodating in allowing us to store our luggage as we arrived/departed before/after check in/out. \r\n\r\nThe apartment was perfect. Located in Midtown East near the UN, in an unbelievably quiet neighborhood. Train stops were accessible within a few short blocks of walking distance. Its close proximity to 5th Avenue, Central Park, & Times Square allowed us to have access to all the touristy NYC sites without any of the noise. I'd highly recommend the flat to anyone.\r\n\r\nOn a side note Joris was in no small way, responsible for salvaging a surprise birthday trip for my girlfriend, which I sincerely appreciate.

Joris is a very nice person. He is always willing to assist you and to accommodate to your requests. He answers almost immediately all your messages. I am quite grateful with him as we could agree on an early check-in and a late check-out. In fact, my parents are in their 80s and I needed to make the trip a comfortable experience for them. 2. Ups (i) The apartment is extremely well located (51st and Second Avenue). It is in midtown and you can enjoy the city just walking. The subway is three blocks away from the apartment. (ii) Even though in midtown, the neighbourhood is tranquil, neat, charming and not noisy. (iii) For New York standards, the apartment is big. Please consider -if you have never been in New York- that places size tend to be quite small in Manhattan. Space is a luxury in the city. (iv) The apartment is on a first floor which is quite helpful as New York's buildings sometimes do not have elevator (you should always ask if there is one if you are renting an apartment). (v) The apartment has one living - dining room, a small kitchen, two bedrooms and two bathrooms. I will not recommend it for more than 4 people. One bedroom is located on the first floor and the second one is located in the basement. (vi) The apartment is cozy. It looks like in the pictures. (vii) The patio is lovely. It is very unusual to find an apartment with its own access to a patio in New York. (vii) The beds are quite comfortable. I travel a lot and stay in several 4-5 stars hotels. The beds were as comfortable as the ones I find in my trips. 3. Matters to be considered: (i) Being the apartment in an old building you can hear the noise of your neighbours, particularly at night, which may cause troubles for having a restful sleep. My parents, who stayed on the first floor, were awaken some nights for the noise coming from the second floor (around midnight, apparently they move furnitures). (ii) The room located in the basement is particularly noisy at nights. It is next to a corridor where the washing machines are located and which also provides access to the patio. As I slept in that room, I needed to wear ear-plugs for not to be awaken at nights. However, one night not even the ear-plugs helped. I heart people walking and talking in the corridor very late that night. I walked up scared as I thought there was actually somebody in my room! (iii) The door in the basement needs curtains. In fact, there is one door which provides access to the patio with a window which allows people in the patio to see...",

Er hat uns vom Flughafen zu unserer Unterkunft und wieder zurück zum Flughafen mit seinem Auto gebracht und zwar gratis. Er wollte einfach nichts von uns nehmen. Für die Stadteroberung haben wir ebenso gratis zwei Fahrräder bekommen. \r\nDie Wohnung befindet sich in einer sehr guten Lage, bis zum Strand braucht man weniger als 15 min. Die Wohnung ist sehr schön eingerichtet mit einem Balkon mit tollem Ausblick über die Stadt. Der Gastgeber war fast nie in der Wohnung und wenn er kurz da ist war er sehr hilfreich und hat uns insider Tipps gegeben. Zum Schlafen hat er ein eigenes Zimmer mit eigenem Bad und WC, somit komplett getrennt von uns. Ganz ehrlich kann ich diese Unterkunft jedem empfehlen und ich hoffe wir werden wieder mal Froilans Gäste sein :)",

The room and amenities are very clean, with extra towels and sheets in the cupboard, should you need them. I was worried about heating since it's winter and the listing didn't have heating ticked, but they provided a thermostat heater that kept us nice and cosy. Another cute thing to note was the deco. There's an adorable kiwi bird toy and some binoculars that we took advantage of with the great view from the window. Also, go up to the terrace! You definitely won't be disappointed at Maria's :)",

The view of course is unbeatable. If this unit were any closer to the ocean, it would have fish in it. It's in a smaller complex, with nobody above you. \r\n\r\nThe neighborhood is okay; appeared to be safe, and there are some eating/shopping options close by, but most restaurants and shops you may want to go to are a little further afield, but not more than a 3-5 minute drive (Kaanapali itself is about 10 minutes away, which is a good thing in my opinion). The road the complex is on is fairly busy, but not too noisy (most cars are going pretty slow here), see more below.\r\n\r\nThe complex itself is pretty old but appeared to be very well-maintained. There's a small beach adjacent to the complex that's okay for recreational bathing but not a destination in itself. The overall vibe was very private and intimate; a very friendly atmosphere. The pool was a huge added bonus for us; the kids wanted to use it practically every day. Honokowai Park was on the other side of the complex; we didn't go here, but the recon I did on a walk gave me the impression that the park was okay but nothing to write home about.\r\n\r\nThe overall noise level here was very minimal; no loud guests or screaming kids. There is some road noise in the front bedroom, and although I wasn't in that bedroom, it wouldn't have bugged me, and I'm a light sleeper. \r\n\r\nThe baths were very nice and almost resort-y; overall, they were very clean although the grout could use a good cleaning, just saying. The kitchen was more than adequate for our needs, and had quite a bit of storage space. We also used the barbecues on premise a couple of times; they're impeccably maintained.\r\n\r\nThe only thing that is a drawback to this place in my opinion is that the loft can get quite stuffy, even with the fans going full blast. We were there in August, and several nights up there were fine, some others were uncomfortable, and there was 2 nights where it was extremely hard to sleep up there.\r\n\r\nSo overall, this place is perfect if you value a tranquil atmosphere with a killer view, in a nice unit in a pleasant complex, at a fair price. If you have enough guests to where you have to utilize the loft, the weather may be a roll of the dice as to how comfortable it is.",

Many of the best beaches and snorkeling as well as downtown Lahaina within 10-15 minute drive.",

It had tons of space, good beds and was very clean. Being less than one block from Las Rambles, I was worried about noise, but once you enter the building, all the city noises go away. Check in was easy as a representative from our host met us at the door, let us in and showed us around. The location was awesome. Literally steps away were many restaurants, shops and other places to go. There is even a small food market 3 doors down on the same street. The main square was a 5 minute walk. When in Barcelona, I would definitely consider staying here again. ",

To extend it to become a bed and making sure that it is fixed correctly, must be extra careful as  my son hurt his hand. \nLiving room aircon - thought aircon was spoilt as we couldnt on it. We didnt know that the switch, which is hidden in the cupboard, is not switch on until when we met Helen when we are checking out.\nOverall, we still can accept and hope that there will be improvement. Thanks to both Jenkin and Helen.",

Jenkin is an accessible and attentive host, and that's something you may need in a complicated city like Hong Kong. This is an efficiently designed very small space which makes it seem larger than it is. The layout is (1) a bed-sized sleeping area with a curtain and sliding door for privacy; (2) a comfortably sized and appointed bathroom with a nicely tiled shower with plenty of hot water and strong water pressure; and (3) a living room with comfortable sofa, reliable wifi, and clothes hanging rack. There is a fridge and microwave and hotplate, with enough cookware for two people. You wash your dishes in the bathroom.  All three rooms are recently remodeled and tiled.  The bed is very comfortable. Both the bedroom and living room have air conditioners.\r\n\r\nThe little apartment is on the 6th floor of an old and dingy (but clean) Kowloon apartment building one block from the stunning fountains of Kowloon Park and the subway, and a million places right there in your face.  It is a 10 minute exciting walk (as in every single time its exciting) to the picturesque  harbor ferry to Hong Kong Island (or you can take the subway there).  Like many Asian buildings, the elevators are very slow and often crowded with friendly people, but remarkably, each floor has an elevator on either end of the hallway. You walk out of Jenkin's apartment, look left and look right to see which elevator will arrive first, a fun little game for us. \r\n\r\nThe very safe neighborhood is extremely trendy, filled with excited locals and tourists, and many places open until late. (My favorite bar and restaurant were open until 3am, both very funky). \r\n\r\nI might stay in one of Jenkin's larger units next time but, you know, I'm not sure since this little place just grows on you after two days.  He is a master host, his cleaning lady is so nice and right nearby, and he takes a lot of pride in making your stay high quality.  He even guided our taxi driver to the front door by cell phone, and he is always, always accessible.  It's remarkable. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

The living space is small but well organized, with a separate bedroom (just big enough for the bed) with its own air-con, and the bathroom is a very usable size. The main drawback to the apartment is that it is on the 6th floor of a 15 floor building and the queues can get long for the elevator. There is one elevator at each end of the long hall on the 6th floor but on the ground level they are completely separated.  A few times I waited on the ground floor in a queue for 15-20 minutes and the elevator fills up before being able to get in, so plan your trips, don't expect to go in and out a lot, and avoid mid-day and evening hours when people are coming home.  Of course this is not an issue the host can resolve, but I think any guests should anticipate.",

Es ist immer was los und selbst wenn mankein türkisch kann,Fatma Abla versucht mit English und Händen und Füßen zu reden. Eine unglaublich sympathische und unterhaltsame Dame, die ich sehr schnell ins Herz geschlossen habe. Sonntags sind wir zusammen zum Bio Bazar gelaufen und an einigen Tagen kochen wir sogar was zusammen.  Mein Zimmer befindet sich im obersten Stock, wo ich komplett meine Ruhe habe. gegenüber von meinem Zimmer ist eine wunderschöne Terasse, die zum Yoga machen oder ein Buch lesen einlädt. Gäste sind auch immer willkommen. Fatma hat ihre eigenen Stil, welches dem ganzen Haus, bis auf den Eingangsbereich, einen unglaublichen charm gibt. Jedes Zimmer ist individuell und man muss sagen, dass bis her die Leute, die ich im Haus kennengelernt habe, echt toll sind. Wenn man sich für Fatma entscheidet, sollte man auf alle Fälle kulturoffen sein und sich diesem schönen antiken Stil und der Nostalgie einfach fallen lassen. Ich bin durch Fatma und durch die Wohnung in einem alten Istanbul angekommen und fühle mich super wohl. Zu meiner Arbeit in Cihangir laufe ich täglich zu Fuß. Die Lage ist sehr perfekt. Ich brauche kaum Bus oder Bahn zu benutzen, da ich alles in Beyoglu und Taksim finde, was ich brauche. Nur für meine Touristentour habe ich lediglich die Bahn benutzt. Obwohl man zum Eminönu auch zu Fuß laufen kann, wenn man spazieren gehen mag. Ich danke Dir, Fatma abla, so wie ich dich gerne zu nennen pflege, für Deine Offenheit und Deine Wärme. Ich werde Dich sehr bald wieder besuchen kommen und hoffentlich sogar mein altes Zimmer beziehen im obersten Stock. ",

The landlords are fantastic and experienced Airbnb hosts, which makes the experienced that much better. Fatma is an outstanding cook, and one should not miss a chance to dine with her and Hasan! The house is great, very typical and nice - as a bonus, the bathrooms were all renovated and they look fantastic. The terrace made for many evenings relaxing away from the hustle and bustle of Istiklal St. In terms of location, the house is in a great spot: seconds away from Istiklal, minutes from Taksim and the cool Cihangir area, and a short train ride or longer walk to Sultanahmet, Topkapi and all the tourist sites. Would recommend without any hesitation, as I already did to two friends of mine who also stayed at Fatma and Hasan's house. ",

The street where the house is on is pretty calm. \r\nThis room is on the same floor with the terrasse and the kitchen, so you have ideal access to both of them. The kitchen is ideal if you just want to cook something small from time to time as there's only one cooking plate.\r\nThis room is perfect for people that wish to be in contact with the host and exchange with them from time to time as you walk by their living room and kitchen as well as share the bathroom with them. If you rather be a little more to your own and mind cigarette smoke, I recommend one of the other rooms.\r\nFatma and Hasan are both very very nice, always asked about my day and they were very patient when I tried to say something in turkish. I hope that my turkish will be better one day so that we can have longer and deeper conversations!  They made me feel very welcomed and I also really enjoyed meeting Fatma's daughter and grandson!They are very generous, sometimes invited me for tea or something to eat. I also got lucky to taste some of Fatma's amazing food! ",

Above all Fatma and Hasan are such nice people, I am really looking forward to stay in contact with them. \r\nI highly recommend the room. But you should have no problem with shareing the bathroom with the hosts as well as shareing the kitchen and the terasse with a lot of other guests who stay in the house.

Our room was big enough for us,shower and toilet in the room, all was perfect. We could use the kitchen, which we did every morning. Well, what else is there to say? I told her, whenever we visit Maui, we will stay with her.

Falta de limpieza absoluta en toda la casa que hacía muy incómoda su estancia y más con niños pequeños. El sofá donde supuestamente se podía dormir, tenía una gran mancha que ni se habían molestado en intentar limpiarla. Solo había un único armario recubierto de moho para guardar la ropa, que evidentemente no pudimos utilizar. La ducha estaba negra, picada y oxidada, lo que nos tocó limpiar a nosotros y desinfectarla un poco para poderla utilizar. La cocina llena cubierta por una capa de grasa que la hacía inútil para cocinar cualquier cosa. Escaleras hacia abajo completamente empinadas y estrechas.  Nada más llegar ni rastro de Regina o Juan, nos atendió una persona que ni siquiera sabía hablar bien castellano, por lo que dudo mucho de la existencia de Juan y Regina. Es absolutamente indignante que cuando pagas el apartamento te cobran unos gastos de limpieza que no han efectuado. Para colmo nos cobraron 30 € en concepto de checking. La zona es tranquila aunque bastante alejada del metro, dado que tienes unas cuestas muy empinadas desde la parada más cernada de metro y luego toca subir cuesta arriba unos 15 minutos. De cara a los esfuerzos por parte del anfitrión, absolutamente ninguno. La persona que nos recibió ni siquiera sabía indicarnos donde estaba la tienda más cercana, un parking donde poder dejar el coche e incluso la parada de metro más cernada. Soy usuario de esta web desde hace tiempo, he visitado otros países de Europa usándola y ha sido con creces la peor experiencia que he tenido. Me siento completamente estafado.",

Il manque cependant un tapis de douche pour la baignoire.\r\nLes matelas étaient confortables et le quartier très calme mis à part un voisin qui mettait parfois de la musique à fond.\r\nAu niveau de l'emplacement, le logement est très bien situé car à 10 minutes à pied d'une ligne de métro qui dessert tous les endroits importants de la ville (plage, centre ville, quartier gothique, etc).\r\nPar contre, attention pour les personnes qui ont des difficultés à se déplacer car le logement est tout en haut d'une côte très raide.\r\nMalgré tout, nous avons passé un agréable séjour dans ce logement et avons apprécié la terrasse ombragée.",

They were friendly and seemed always ready to be of help if I needed it.  Moreover, they had it worked out almost to the last detail:  when I arrived they already had neat packages, clearly labelled, of take-out menus for area restaurants, they had directions to local shops and businesses - all of which were in walking distance, and they had clear directions to the nearby subways, and there was a list of house rules - none of which were unacceptable. Overall, it was like spending a weekend at a friend's place.  The neighborhood was quite busy with people and shops until late into the night, but the room was quiet, clean and comfortable.  I slept like a baby.  I would only suggest that you confirm your check in and check out times with them in advance so as to avoid any confusion. I would stay here again if I needed to take another trip to NYC in the future - for sure.",

She was very accommodating our rushed arrival (we had dinner res.!) and had a great printout regarding any questions we might have about her home. \r\n\r\nWe really enjoyed her cat Tsitsou. I have a cat allergy but she was so friendly and hospitable that I even managed to give her a few good pats. Teodora's place is very clean, so my allergic reaction was minimal. \r\n\r\nThe location is great. It's less than a 10 min walk to the Metro and very easy to find street parking. We enjoyed the garden space very much. We sat out there one late afternoon and felt as though we were truly Montreal residents!\r\n\r\nOne suggestion I make (which is NOT a deal breaker) is perhaps a small fan in the guest room. The windows are not very big, and we kept the door closed, to keep Tsitsou out, and it got stuffy pretty quickly. \r\n\r\nI will be giving Teodora a 10/10 and we hope to come back to visit soon!",

Rooms in the house were on separate ends making for more privacy. \nMy flight had been delayed multiple times, Vick was nice enough to allow my guest to check in without me. He and his sister, Maria were very fast in responding to our needs and even checking on us to make sure we were okay. \nDue to late flight departure, both Vick and Maria allowed later check out times to accommodate us. I would recommend this spot for small groups and I would love to stay here again! \nThanks so much! Trip successful! ",

The apartment is beautifully appointed, fresh spotless linen, a bowl of fruit, chocolates, and even an array of teabags and biscuits to have with my coffee. Such a lovely surprise. It's a spacious apartment with two beautiful bathrooms and amazing views. Even a large balcony with deck chairs. This apartment truly had everything we needed. There was a chemist near the ground floor doors, and a convenience store as well; coffee shops and cafes are nearby, and an excellent DFO shopping centre nearby (within walking distance; 1.3km I think).  I recommend this apartment to you without hesitation. Thanks Nicole! We'll be back!",

We cooked a lot and she was very respectful of giving us space that we were seeking.  Overall the price was awesome the area was great Sabrina was very cool and so is her decor in her home!

He sent us a detailed \"Welcome Packet\" which included very useful tips for our Maui adventure. The condo was 100% clean and included everything one may need to prepare meals and have an enjoyable and relaxing stay. Prior to our arrival, he actually replaced most all the kitchen items such as silverware, dishes, cooking utensils, pots and pans, etc. The furnishings (including the beds) were extremely comfortable and the panoramic view, condo grounds and beach were SPECTACULAR!!! It was especially nice having a casual open-air restaurant on the property. Served breakfast, lunch and dinner.\r\n\r\nWe're already looking forward to returning :-)\r\n\r\nNancy, Rich, Jeff & Robbie\r\n\r\n",

I love how the master has huge sliding doors that you can open up for more space or close for privacy.\n\nRajeev was a excellent and very personable host.  He gave us super recommendations.  I only wish we could have done them all.\n\nWe had a glitch with my name on checkin and he called me directly a short time after to check and make sure everything was taken care of.\n\nHe always responded very quickly after any email, text or phone call.  Such a great host.\n\nThe grounds were also fantastic, great pool and hot tub.  The cafe on the grounds was a great place to eat dinner or breakfast if you didn't want to drive anywhere and the beach is beautiful.\n\nBecause it's not part of the huge resorts it feels much more private, but only minutes away from great shops, restaurants and water fun.\n\nIf we ever get back to Maui, we will definitely be looking this one up again.",

This is complemented by nice (and some antique) decorative details.\nA pleasant surprise was the smell of freshly baked bread every morning in the staircase. The downstairs neighbour is a bakery where you can get good and cheap bread and your morning espresso.\n\nWe have had contact with Teresa through AirBNB, she has been helpful and kind. Tim welcomed us with a gastronomic surprise and even a list of suggestions for our stay in Porto. They are a very hospitable and helpful couple!\n\nThank you Teresa and Tim!",

We were even provided with a welcoming gift! \nThere are, however, two downsides: the apartment is not equipped with an airconditioner or fan (which is not disastrous, but it can get pretty hot if you're not used to Portugese summers), and sounds from upstairs neighbours and the busy road it lies on can be heard at night. If you're a light sleeper, I suggest taking soundproof earplugs with you. \nOtherwise, it's a beautiful apartment if you want to enjoy both the city center of Porto and the beach!",

Lamentablemente, es difícil llevarse una imagen positiva después de que te roben. El día antes de nuestra partida encontramos la luna del coche rota, y todo lo que había de valor, sustraído. Es una práctica habitual, no fue una excepción. La consiguiente desesperación, al estar \"abandonados\" en otro país, sólo la conoce quien la padece. Además, no habíamos aparcado en una zona  conflictiva, sino en un barrio residencial, muy cerca del apartamento. \nLo verdaderamente problemático no es el robo en sí, sino el hecho, ante la perspectiva de un largo viaje para volver a casa, de no tener ayuda posible: que el seguro no responda, no tener internet en el teléfono, etcétera, hecho que probablemente constituya un incentivo para los ladrones, pues es obvio que actúan desde el rencor.\nSi Margarida dispone el aparcamiento trasero a la casa todo será más seguro. No le recomiendo a nadie dejar el coche en la calle.\nEs recomendable también, controlar los precios de las tarifas de datos, ya que la Wi-Fi que nos fue brindada solo funcionó el primer día, y se hace muy necesaria estando de viaje. \nPor otro lado, es difícil llegar a entender para un español (que tenemos fama de fiesteros y gritones) como es posible que en una zona residencial todas las noches se reúna gente en una plaza a beber y hablar hasta las cuatro o cinco de la mañana. El caso es que como la visita ha sido en agosto y el calor era insoportable, teníamos que tener las ventanas abiertas y era muy difícil dormir, pues la gente no tenía ninguna consideración ni civismo en este aspecto.\nEsto no pretende ser una crítica destructiva; quizá tuvimos mala suerte, y aunque creo que hay aspectos a mejorar, el apartamento es una  buena oportunidad para conocer la ciudad, sobre todo por su relación calidad-precio y porque Margarida responde siempre con una sonrisa. Aun teniendo en cuenta los aspectos señalados, estoy seguro de que con el tiempo el recuerdo será bueno.",

Also the wooden floor is nice, and the kitchen is small but modern and has all you need to prepare small meals.\nCommunication and check-in was very professional. The flat was super clean.

Sissa is an amazing host; she welcomed us in person to hand the keys over, took the time to tell us about where to go and what to see in Porto and even offered us a great snack (delicious bread, cheese, homemade jelly and wine– more like a lunch) when we arrived. Staying there really felt like home. The green and flowery terrace is very intimate. If you wish to cook, the kitchen is very well-equipped. We were only two, but the apartment could perfectly host a family. I would not hesitate recommending this place to even the most picky of travellers!",

Isabel was a gracious host who kept in good communication.  There was a small issue with check-in (the concierge was late to drop off our keys) and if you are a light sleeper you may want to bring earplugs as noise from the upstairs neighbours tended to reverberate through the floorboards.

It is near all the major sites and a 15 minute walk to The Riberia with restaurants, boat trips and Port caves. \nThe only suggestion would be for the concierge management, in that we were booked for a 15:30 check- in and were left waiting outside until 16:20 on the footpath/sidewalk until Louisa from the management company arrived, I understand traffic can be a problem, but would have appreciated a text or phone call as to the delay. I had to message the management service to find out any information and was only told someone was on the way - but no time indication.\nWe asked where would we find a grocery store and again Louisa did not have this information, nor recommendations. \nThe door to the apartment jammed and she could not get it opened, luckily my husband was able to 'pound' on the door to help us get in. When we tested the door to get out of the apartment again, she was unable to open the door. If my husband had not been with me, I or any women would not be able to get in or out of the apartment. Louisa said she would report this problem and hopefully, it will be resolved before the next people arrive. \nI would recommend this apartment when visiting Porto for location, and general facilities in the apartment.

Location is superb, just 300 meters from San Bentos station, and I literally walk everywhere and did not use any public transport at all and all attraction is less then 700meters from her place, shoping, restaurants and bars below her place but yet NOT noisy at night.  Can't find better place to stay in Porto.   \r\n\r\nDulce is swift in respond and met me in arrival despite delay of 2 hours and gave orientation of her place.  She also as assisted to book me a taxi at 4:30am to airport for my early flight.\r\n\r\nHighly recommend for you to stay at Dulce place! You will not regret :) enjoy beautiful PORTO!",

Cátia provided a comprehensive overview of Porto when we met her at the flat and all her recommendations of what to see, where to go and restaurants to eat at were excellent. We didn't have time for your francesinha challenge Cátia but we'll take it up next time! The flat is in an excellent location; easy walking distance from attractions, but also in an area of great local bars and shops. Many happy times watching the world go by, and the football, at Cafe Java. And of course the roof top terrace is an excellent place to relax and enjoy wine, or beer, after a day of exploring the steep streets and many steps of Porto. We will most definitely be returning. Thank you Cátia and David.",

I much prefer the location of Marilyn's Condo in Kihei versus the more toursity Lahaina resort section, which is why we selected this location. It is less than 15 minutes to the best beach in the world, Big Beach! A short 25 minute drive to the airport.  the location was also great for our snorkling tour which docked across the street. We only went up the north west side of maui for our luau and parasailing, which the drive is kinda far for that, but not too bad to do twice. Loved the we were able to use the beach chairs and umbrella, THEY ARE A MUST on a sunny day at the beach!!! Only draw back, which is common, was no air conditioning, but we knew that going into it!",

Her place is charming, but lacks air conditioning.  I'm from the Central Valley of CA & know heat, but the place is too hot to be in from 12-5pm, even with the drapes closed & the fans on high.  This meant we often could not eat lunch at the apartment & had to eat in town or take something in the morning when we left.\r\n  The upstairs neighbor also has a loud, aggressive, barking dog that we could hear most evenings.  The neighbor also chooses to brush her dog on the balcony, letting the dog hair fall onto Marilyn's patio below, even when we are sitting outside.\r\n  The final reason, most evenings we would return to the smell of pot from neighbors.  Some may not mind this, but it bothers me.  \r\n  I know most of these are not within Marilyn's control, but they did make our stay less than desirable. As mentioned, she was a pleasant host & quickly responded to any questions we had & made us feel welcome in her home.\r\n",

Everything that we wanted to do and had planned was super close to the condo. The beach across the street is great. Just steps from the condo and never over crowded. The little town just down the road has great restaurants and shops to grab some Souvenirs. We would definitely suggest checking out the Paia fish market for lunch/dinner. You can't go wrong grabbing breakfast at the Kihei Cafe. Make sure to get there early and bring cash!! That's all they accept. \nIf you head in the other direction towards Waliea-Makena you can go to Makena park. Big beach is located here. It's a beautiful beach. The waves get a little big though, so keep that in mind. \nMarilyn's condo had everything we needed. The view is beautiful. The complex is clean and very quiet. We never saw or heard another person the whole week we were there. It felt like we were the only couple in the complex. Our only concern at first was that there is no AC, but after one night, we quickly realized that it was not needed. Marilyn provides multiple fans and Maui gets very cool at night. With the fan and cool breeze, we slept great!! \nWe managed to get around most of the Island while we were in Maui. And honestly, we always found ourselves wanting to go right back to Kiehi! It's a\nVery relaxed and laid back community with not an overwhelming amount of touristy activity, which is exactly what we wanted. \nWe definitely will be back to Maui and would LOVE to stay at Marilyn's condo again!!!!

The facilities were fantastic and we enjoyed using the pool (which is also a lot bigger in person) which has stunning views over Rio, including Christ the Redeemer on Corcovado mountain. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful and learnt our faces immediately so we had no problem at all gaining access to the very secure apartment (the staff buzz you in the gates via CCTV). The neighbourhood is more downtown Rio and if you like a good night out it will be perfect for you. We didn't feel that the neighbourhood was the safest of areas in Rio, but then again anywhere in Rio during the night isn't the safest place to be. The noise from the street at night was sometimes a little loud especially on Fridays and Saturdays which are extremely busy times in Lapa however we understand that this noise is unavoidable and inevitable. It must also be taken into consideration that we were in Rio for the busiest two weeks of the year, during the 2016 Olympics, a time when at night there were hundreds of thousands of tourists on the streets as well as the locals! Despite this as soon as we entered the double electronic gated apartment block we felt completely at ease and safe and during or time in Rio we spent one of the day's exploring Lapa, admiring its arches and the colourful artwork and graffiti that the locality had to offer. The apartment was perfect for us, size, location, accessibility were all excellent. Our neighbours were very friendly and helpful and would always say \"good morning\" and \"good evening\" in the elevator throughout the day. There was a very convenient supermarket just 1 minutes  walk from the apartment and the kitchen had everything you could possible need. If however you prefer to eat out, Lapa has many excellent bars and restaurants and so does Copacabana and Ipanena if you want to travel a little further away. The shower was particularly excellent-hot water was always in abundance. This apartment had everything we wanted and we couldn't have asked for a better place to stay during our time spent in Rio De Janeiro for the Olympics. If and when we ever return to Rio Dejanira's apartment is the only option for us and we would love to stay there again.",

The sink drained realy slowly so was a little discouraging.  Shower was fine, water pressure a little low.  2) our room, the Green Room, is right on St. Denis - trucks ROARing woke us early a.m.  3) be sure to take your room key with you when you go to the bathroom, etc, otherwise your door will lock!  Maybe I'm fussier than my younger reviewers, but these are important to note.  Otherwise, a very nice stay with friendly and knowledgable hosts.\r\n",

Lots of restaurants and a few coffee shops nearby with easy access to Kings Cross Station for your metro needs.\n\nGreat stay overall!",

When i check the location, had to cancel and rushed to my ultimate accommodation portal, broadcasting generic message to nearby hosts to secure an accommodation the soonest.\r\n\r\nAlison was among the first to reply, and to pre-confirm...\r\nBy the time i got there, Adam was already waiting for me and even kind enough to give me all the directions at 8am and off course waited for me outside to make sure that i'm paying the right cab fee. \r\n\r\nWhat can i say Adam, made feel at home from very first moment, kind, genuine and warm welcoming host. The house is is really nice fully refurbished, in a quite and well connected neighbourhood. My room was upstairs, a nice sunny room with  a queen bed and a bathroom attached. After i dropped in my luggage, Adam gave me guided orientation tour to the house, with access to all amenities. \r\n\r\nFelt like a VIP 5 star treatment as Adam even gave me a pre-paid bus ticket, which made my first(s) bus rides easier as some stations are pre-paid only.  So now that you that i have been at a great apartment, with great hosts, that's all, Rozelle is a really nice neighbourhood. walking distance from my hosts' place, you can make it to the main street packed, with cafe, bars and restaurant, a vibrant market and lot of attractions. if you happen to stay over a weekend don't miss Rozelle Market (Sat & Sun). \r\n\r\nNow the funny part, Adam was so happy to receive me as he's a all star backgammon player and he knows that Lebanese people are really good at that and he was so eager for round. One night we decided to play a round and Adam's expectations went all down the drain, i think i was the first Lebanese ever to be clumsy backgammon player. We agree that we will play another time via (Hidden by Airbnb) and i will have support from fellow Lebanese players :)\r\n\r\nAll in all, i great time, the house is warm, clean, and comfortable and the hosts are simply AWESOME  \r\n\r\n ",

Falta de limpieza absoluta en toda la casa que hacía muy incómoda su estancia y más con niños pequeños. El sofá donde supuestamente se podía dormir, tenía una gran mancha que ni se habían molestado en intentar limpiarla. Solo había un único armario recubierto de moho para guardar la ropa, que evidentemente no pudimos utilizar. La ducha estaba negra, picada y oxidada, lo que nos tocó limpiar a nosotros y desinfectarla un poco para poderla utilizar. La cocina llena cubierta por una capa de grasa que la hacía inútil para cocinar cualquier cosa. Escaleras hacia abajo completamente empinadas y estrechas.  Nada más llegar ni rastro de Regina o Juan, nos atendió una persona que ni siquiera sabía hablar bien castellano, por lo que dudo mucho de la existencia de Juan y Regina. Es absolutamente indignante que cuando pagas el apartamento te cobran unos gastos de limpieza que no han efectuado. Para colmo nos cobraron 30 € en concepto de checking. La zona es tranquila aunque bastante alejada del metro, dado que tienes unas cuestas muy empinadas desde la parada más cernada de metro y luego toca subir cuesta arriba unos 15 minutos. De cara a los esfuerzos por parte del anfitrión, absolutamente ninguno. La persona que nos recibió ni siquiera sabía indicarnos donde estaba la tienda más cercana, un parking donde poder dejar el coche e incluso la parada de metro más cernada. Soy usuario de esta web desde hace tiempo, he visitado otros países de Europa usándola y ha sido con creces la peor experiencia que he tenido. Me siento completamente estafado.",

De plus, dans l'immeuble l'escalier est très étroit et il n'y pas pas d'ascenseur. L'accès peut donc être difficile pour les familles avec enfants en bas age, les personnes agées et les personnes a mobilité reduites surtout qu' il est situé dans l'étages du bas de l'immeuble, sous le rez de chaussé. \r\nLes photos ne sont pas très fidèle a la réalité car l'apparetement manque de luminosité, effet, a part la terrasse, il y a un manque de fenêtres et aucunes de donne sur l’extérieur. La seule autre fenêtre présente dans une des chambres donne sur l'escalier de l'immeuble.  \r\nDu fait de ce manque de fenêtre, l'appartement n'est pas très lumineux et sens le renfermé.\r\nIl y a de plus une mauvaise insonorisation de l'appartement mais cela n'a pas été très gênant car l'immeuble était dans l'ensemble plutôt calme. \r\nPoint positif : hôte sympathique et disponible, proximité du parc Guell et des transports en commun \r\nEtant donné le rapport qualité prix, je pense qu'il convient surtout a un groupe d'amis ",

We thoroughly enjoyed the outdoor terrace and spent our mornings out there to eat the breakfast we had prepared in the well equipped kitchen. We did, however, wish there had been some basic kitchen ingredients like salt, spices, or oil there for us to use. The location was a quick walk to Park Güell and it was nice being in a non touristy area. That did however, mean that it was not as easy to reach the city center. ",

Our room and bathroom were clean and the beds comfortable for our family of three.  The internet worked well and her rooftop terrace was pleasant for afternoon tea and breakfast.  In fact, Nuria offered us tea on the roof upon our arrival.  We enjoyed having use of the kitchen during our stay.  The elevator in her building was nice for carrying luggage up and down.  Our Spanish and Nuria’s English were minimal, but we were able to communicate.  This is certainly not a luxurious place, but good for those traveling within a budget.   ",

Our flight was delayed and we didn't arrive until 10pm, but I was able to notify her through (Hidden by Airbnb) just before we took off and she was fine about it. She  has a small VW Pollo which we just managed to fit all 3 of our big bags in to, plus us 3 and Nuria! She pointed out the closest metro station (Lesseps) on the way to her house and made us tea on the Terrace upon arrival to her home. She doesn't speak English so we communicated in Spanish. The room was fine for us, a very narrow apartment, as are most apartments in Barcelona. A small lift was good to take our luggage up as the apartment is the top of 6 or so levels. We had a fan in our room and a big open window which was great as it was hot! Shower is either hot or cold and bathroom shared with another guest room. Towels provided. Showers between 7:00 and 22:00 as bathroom is inbetween the 2 guest rooms and that rule is to help keep noise levels to a minimum for any guests who might prefer to sleep from 10pm. Approx 15 mins walk to Park Guell which was great! And about 25 mins walk to La Sagrada Familia. A really great fruit/vegetable/organic produce with the best of everything just a few streets away. Access to fridge available on request. Access to cutlery, crockery and microwave (not oven or stove). Great strong wifi connection. A few barking dogs in the neighborhood, but otherwise quiet. Nuria kindly offered for us to leave our luggage for the day as we were checking out, but we didn't need to. Nuria seemed to do a bit of work from home, she kept out of our way, but was around if we had needed to ask her anything. Over all our stay was good. Muchas Gracias Nuria!",
